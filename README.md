# dust_charge_distribution
Routine for computing the dust charge distribution


These are the original files from the 2020 version.


For this version, dust charges are computed simply from the equilibrium
between photoionisation and accretion of ions/electrons.

Gas composition is currently hardcoded.

Stellar spectra already included are: ISRF and Solar.
