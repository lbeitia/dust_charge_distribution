# dust_charge_distribution
Routine for computing the dust charge distribution


This is the 2022 version, with several updates with respect to the 2020v.


For this version, dust charges are computed from the equilibrium
between photoionisation and accretion of ions/electrons, but cosmic rays can
be included as well.

Several ionic species can be introduced via the input_file.

Stellar spectra already included are: ISRF and Solar.
