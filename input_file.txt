#
#                  GRAIN PROPERTIES
#
#	rad: dust grain radius in microns
#	material: grain material, either "silicate" or "carbonaceous"
#	Z0: reference charge. By default use Z0 = 0.
#	Zmin: minimum charge desired.
#	Zmax: maximum charge desired.
rad = 0.1
material = silicate
Z0 = -25
Zmin = -50
Zmax = 0
#                  GAS PROPERTIES
#	composition: Gas composition. By default is set to H
#	T: temperature in K
#	dens: density in cm-3
#	frac_ion: ionization fraction
composition = H
T = 6000
dens = 0.57
frac_ion = 1
#                  RADIATION FIELD
#	rf: radiation field selected. 1 = MMP83, 2 = SunRF
#       rf_intensity: intensity of the radiation field, between 0 and 1.
